My name is Zubair Abdullah, and I'm excited to share my journey with you. I've always been passionate about Data Analyst,System Design, and Cloud Architect. but it wasn't until recently that I decided to take the leap and pursue it part-time.

I'm still learning and growing, but I believe that sharing my journey with others can be both inspiring and informative. By documenting my successes and failures, I hope to provide valuable insights and tips for anyone else who is starting out on a similar path.

On this website, you'll find [blog posts](https://zubdev.online/series/), videos, podcasts, etc. I'll be sharing my thoughts, experiences, and lessons learned along the way. I hope that by doing so, I can help others who are also on their own journey.

I don't have all the answers yet, and I don't have a team to support me, but I'm determined to make this work. I believe that with hard work, perseverance, and a little bit of luck, anything is possible.

Thank you for joining me on this journey. I look forward to connecting with you and sharing our experiences together.
you can find my social platform on the footer ðŸ‘‡
