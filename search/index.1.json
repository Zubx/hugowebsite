I\u0026rsquo;ve always been passionate about Data Analyst,System Design, and Cloud Architect. but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t until recently that I decided to take the leap and pursue it part-time.\nI\u0026rsquo;m still learning and growing, but I believe that sharing my journey with others can be both inspiring and informative. By documenting my successes and failures, I hope to provide valuable insights and tips for anyone else who is starting out on a similar path.\nOn this website, you\u0026rsquo;ll find blog posts, videos, podcasts, etc. I\u0026rsquo;ll be sharing my thoughts, experiences, and lessons learned along the way. I hope that by doing so, I can help others who are also on their own journey.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t have all the answers yet, and I don\u0026rsquo;t have a team to support me, but I\u0026rsquo;m determined to make this work. I believe that with hard work, perseverance, and a little bit of luck, anything is possible.\nThank you for joining me on this journey. I look forward to connecting with you and sharing our experiences together. you can find my social platform on the footer ðŸ‘‡\n","date":"March 3, 2023","img":"/news/2023/03/welcome-to-my-website/my-feature.webp","lang":"en","langName":"English","largeImg":"/news/2023/03/welcome-to-my-website/my-feature_hu3e623c9c9fd01024575659d71bef7e13_785878_500x0_resize_q75_h2_box_2.webp","permalink":"/news/2023/03/welcome-to-my-website/","series":[{"title":"News","url":"/series/news/"}],"smallImg":"/news/2023/03/welcome-to-my-website/my-feature_hu3e623c9c9fd01024575659d71bef7e13_785878_180x0_resize_q75_h2_box_2.webp","tags":[{"title":"Crop","url":"/tags/crop/"},{"title":"Fit","url":"/tags/fit/"},{"title":"Fill","url":"/tags/fill/"},{"title":"Filters","url":"/tags/filters/"}],"timestamp":1677814487,"title":"Welcome to My Website"},{"authors":[],"categories":[{"title":"Installation","url":"/categories/installation/"}],"content":"This guide show you how to install on Arch Linux.\n","date":"September 6, 2022","img":"","lang":"en","langName":"English","largeImg":"","permalink":"/docs/installation/linux/archlinux/","series":[{"title":"Guide","url":"/series/guide/"}],"smallImg":"","tags":[{"title":"Linux","url":"/tags/linux/"},{"title":"Arch Linux","url":"/tags/arch-linux/"}],"timestamp":1662475343,"title":"Install on Arch Linux"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"A fast, responsive and feature-rich Hugo theme for blog and documentations site.\n","date":"September 6, 2022","img":"","lang":"en","langName":"English","largeImg":"","permalink":"/docs/introduction/","series":[{"title":"Guide","url":"/series/guide/"}],"smallImg":"","tags":[],"timestamp":1662475343,"title":"Introduction"},{"authors":[],"categories":[{"title":"Installation","url":"/categories/installation/"}],"content":"This guide show you how to install on Ubuntu.\n","date":"September 6, 2022","img":"","lang":"en","langName":"English","largeImg":"","permalink":"/docs/installation/linux/ubuntu/","series":[{"title":"Guide","url":"/series/guide/"}],"smallImg":"","tags":[{"title":"Linux","url":"/tags/linux/"},{"title":"Ubuntu","url":"/tags/ubuntu/"}],"timestamp":1662475343,"title":"Install on Ubuntu"},{"authors":[],"categories":[{"title":"Installation","url":"/categories/installation/"}],"content":"This guide show you how to install on Windows.\n","date":"September 6, 2022","img":"","lang":"en","langName":"English","largeImg":"","permalink":"/docs/installation/windows/","series":[{"title":"Guide","url":"/series/guide/"}],"smallImg":"","tags":[{"title":"Windows","url":"/tags/windows/"}],"timestamp":1662475343,"title":"Install on Windows"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"See also README.md.\n","date":"April 17, 2022","img":"","lang":"en","langName":"English","largeImg":"","permalink":"/blog/readme/","series":[],"smallImg":"","tags":[{"title":"README","url":"/tags/readme/"}],"timestamp":1650184529,"title":"README"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Written in Go, Hugo is an open source static site generator available under the Apache Licence 2.0.
